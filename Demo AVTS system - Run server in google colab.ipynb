Ông Ugur Sahin, Giám đốc điều hành Công ty BioNTech (Đức) - đối tác phát triển vắc-xin Covid-19 của Pfizer, cũng tự tin khẳng định khả năng sản phẩm của họ có tác dụng chống lại biến thể mới là \"tương đối cao\", đặc biệt là khi các protein trên biến thể mới giống đến 99% so với chủng gốc. Cũng theo ông Sahin, nếu cần thiết, BioNTech có thể điều chỉnh vắc-xin chỉ trong 6 tuần để phù hợp với biến thể Covid-19 mới. Trong bối cảnh hàng chục nước trên thế giới ngăn chặn dòng người và hàng hóa từ Anh để phòng tránh biến thể mới, giới khoa học đang chạy đua để tìm hiểu nguồn gốc và quy mô của mối đe dọa này. Trung tâm Kiểm soát và Phòng ngừa dịch bệnh châu Âu (ECDC) khẳng định virus luôn thay đổi thông qua đột biến và SARS-CoV-2 cũng không ngoại lệ. Do đó, sự xuất hiện của biến thể mới đã được lường trước và bản thân nó không phải là một mối lo ngại. Trước biến thể này, nhiều biến thể khác cũng đã xuất hiện nhưng phần lớn là lành tính.'''\r\n","gg = a.run_embeddings(line, num_sentences=2)\r\n","gg"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embedding are fine-tuned or trained.\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[-0.01461767, -0.01444326, -0.05597923, ..., -0.14172743,\n","        -0.04709966,  0.05490574],\n","       [-0.18316782, -0.02496537, -0.00160482, ..., -0.08566773,\n","         0.05813466, -0.03679007]], dtype=float32)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sDhFjvgRl__m","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608777296005,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":801,"user":{"displayName":"Xuân Hậu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgQfpuADvOgMS7HfRPiTlh5babgWnyu-g-0fOFb_g=s64","userId":"15964709853204571324"}},"outputId":"48dff24a-2439-4596-f828-e6cea48611f3"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["2"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":32}]}]}
